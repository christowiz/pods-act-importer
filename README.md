From the author:

"I created a plugin (starting from Wp Ultimate CSV Importer - http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ultimate-csv-importer/) to import data into the tables of the Pods Advanced Content Types. The plugin can import data from a CSV file or a MySql. It allow you map the field to import or to add a constant (last option of the select box). It olso generate permalinks based on @name and it can generate @created & @modified date. If you select 'wp posts' table as source you can import post_types and custom fields as (columns) in the advanced content type table ."
